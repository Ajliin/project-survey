# Technigo React Starter App

1. Project brief:
   By making a Typeform like product practicing React state and controlled forms. Once a user has submitted the survey you create, it doesn't actually need to be submitted anywhere - the focus here is to practice using React state and controlling forms, they should see a summary

2. About the project
   Used React state and controlling forms and components. Have split up every component with own css. I also challanged myself trying to do own design and more colorful background and am really pleased with that result. Some people have mentioned it is reminding of Technigo and yeah, I guess it is :) Semanticly I tried to be without divs, for better acessibility.

I validated the project via:
https://validator.w3.org/
Lighthouse chrome extension

If I had more time I would fix better answer for summary and also change the range for more user friendly and gone through with screen reader
